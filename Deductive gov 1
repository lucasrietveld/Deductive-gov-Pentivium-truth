## Statement
The Pentivium is a compact, portable epistemic architecture for testing, funding, and sustaining public goods. It divides reasoning into five interlocking wheels — **Grammar** (existence/past stock), **Logic** (consequence/future), **Rhetoric** (voice/present), **Praxis** (execution/timeframe), and **Presence** (witness/ongoing). Each public proposition or program must be evaluated by the Pentivium’s irreducibles: does it honestly describe what exists; does its consequence follow; does its rhetoric truthfully communicate value; can it be executed transparently with measurable results; and is there persistent public witness to hold it accountable?  

When the purse follows this test, funding becomes an ongoing, reversible vote for truth. This is **Deductive Government**: funding follows proof, not power.

## 5-Term Glossary
- **Grammar:** The stock and names that define what exists (the purse, budgets, institutional memory).  
- **Logic:** The chain of consequences — measurable claims and predicted outcomes.  
- **Rhetoric:** The public argument — ethos, pathos, logos — that convinces citizens to allocate.  
- **Praxis:** Concrete implementation: timetables, KPIs, receipts, and execution discipline.  
- **Presence:** Real-time witness and audit: ledgers, reports, and citizens’ continuing ability to reallocate.

## 3 Worked Examples
1. **Tortoise Sanctuary Pilot**  
   - Grammar: $1,000 seed pot  
   - Logic: build 10 burrows → measure burrow count  
   - Rhetoric: narrative + photos  
   - Praxis: external receipts + volunteer log  
   - Presence: public ledger + 30-day report  
   → Funded if measurable burrows ≥ 8.  

2. **Neighborhood Water Tank**  
   - Grammar: municipal micro-fund  
   - Logic: tank reduces dry days from 10→2/month  
   - Rhetoric: community testimony  
   - Praxis: contract with installer  
   - Presence: flow sensors + public dashboard  
   → If metric met, continue funding.  

3. **Local Defense Core**  
   - Grammar: base allocation for emergency capacity  
   - Logic: response time < 30 min  
   - Rhetoric: public safety case  
   - Praxis: audited drills + receipts  
   - Presence: independent review board  
   → Funding persists only while tests pass.

## Transparency Note
I am publishing the Pentivium packet to seed a precise, public framework for Deductive Government. My intention: public clarity and stewardship, not hidden manipulation. This packet is canonical (v1.0). If you reuse it, please cite this source. I invite volunteers to form a small, diverse stewardship group to guard definitions, monitor misuse, and steward future versions.
