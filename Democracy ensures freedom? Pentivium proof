# Pentivium Proof: "Democracy ensures freedom"

## Claim
> Democracy ensures freedom.

---

## 1. Grammar (Existence / Past Stock)
- **Irreducibles:**  
  - Phonology: “democracy” (Greek demos+kratos), “freedom” (OE frēodōm).  
  - Morphology: both terms stable but historically limited (slavery under “democracy”).  
  - Lexicon: words exist across centuries with contested meanings.  
- **Verdict:** Claim exists in language but carries **contradictory stock**.

---

## 2. Logic (Consequence / Future)
- If democracy ensures freedom, all democracies should preserve liberty.  
- Counterexamples: Weimar Germany → dictatorship; modern democracies with censorship.  
- **Verdict:** Claim is **unsound as absolute**.

---

## 3. Rhetoric (Persuasion / Present)
- Ethos: aligns with revolutionary ideals.  
- Pathos: appeals to hope, patriotism.  
- Logos: oversimplified cause/effect.  
- **Verdict:** Persuasive slogan, but **persuasion exceeds truth**.

---

## 4. Praxis (Execution / Results)
- Democracies: mixed results — some preserve rights, others restrict.  
- **Verdict:** Democracy **helps** freedom but does not guarantee it.

---

## 5. Presence (Witness / All Time)
- Freedom requires vigilance; democracy is only a tool.  
- **Verdict:** Claim is **false if absolute, partial if refined**.

---

## Final Crown Verdict
**Refined claim:**  
> Democracy supports freedom, but only when citizens actively guard it.
