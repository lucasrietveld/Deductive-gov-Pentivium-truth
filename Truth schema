# Minimal structural schema for the Pentivium Proof of Truth

pentivium:
  wheels:
    - name: Grammar
      role: "Existence / Past Stock"
      irreducibles: [Phonology, Morphology, Lexicon]
      derivatives: [Word Formation, Expansion, Euphony]
      crown: "Existence is proven when language is legible, stable, and true to its stock."
    - name: Logic
      role: "Consequence / Future"
      irreducibles: [Syntax, Semantics, Consequence]
      derivatives: [Validity, Soundness, Deduction]
      crown: "Reason is proven when outcomes follow without contradiction."
    - name: Rhetoric
      role: "Persuasion / Present"
      irreducibles: [Ethos, Pathos, Logos]
      derivatives: [Resonance, Trust, Connection]
      crown: "Persuasion is proven when resonance aligns with truth."
    - name: Praxis
      role: "Execution / Results"
      irreducibles: [Intention, Execution, Results]
      derivatives: [Effectiveness, Discipline, Responsibility]
      crown: "Action is proven when results honor intention responsibly."
    - name: Presence
      role: "Witness / All Time"
      irreducibles: [Awareness, Embodiment, Agency]
      derivatives: [Armament Presence, Presence Projection, Witnessing]
      crown: "Truth is revealed when all-time witness exposes or upholds the claim."

  geometry:
    nodes: "Irreducibles and derivatives are nodes."
    edges: "Lines connecting nodes; represent relationships."
    triangles: "Each wheel forms a triangle of irreducibles."
    pentagram: "Five interlocked triangles form the Pentivium star."
    spiral: "Sequential proofs expand into a Truth Spiral."
    lattice: "The full interconnected network of all wheels, crowns, and verdicts."

  verdicts:
    wheel_verdict: "A short judgment sentence at the end of each wheel."
    crown_verdict: "Final distilled truth that survives all five wheels."
